# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

An enhanced version of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, featuring five gestures instead of three. This variation was popularized by the TV show *The Big Bang Theory* and reduces the probability of ties while adding strategic depth.

## 🎮 About The Project

This browser-based game implements the five-gesture expansion of Rock Paper Scissors, adding Lizard and Spock to the traditional options. Players compete against a computer opponent with each gesture having two winning scenarios, making the game more dynamic and entertaining.

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Playing the Game

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DjMcvay142/rockPaperScissorsLizardSpock.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd rockPaperScissorsLizardSpock
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser

Alternatively, play the live version here: [Live Demo](#) *(add GitHub Pages link if deployed)*

## 🎯 Game Rules

Each gesture defeats two others and is defeated by two others:

- ✂️ **Scissors** cuts Paper and decapitates Lizard
- 📄 **Paper** covers Rock and disproves Spock
- 🪨 **Rock** crushes Lizard and crushes Scissors
- 🦎 **Lizard** poisons Spock and eats Paper
- 🖖 **Spock** smashes Scissors and vaporizes Rock

### How to Play

1. Select one of the five gestures: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock
2. The computer randomly selects its gesture
3. The winner is determined by the rules above
4. Score is tracked across multiple rounds
5. Try to outsmart the computer and achieve the highest score!

## 📚 Learning Objectives

This project builds upon my original Rock Paper Scissors game and helped me practice:

- Implementing more complex game logic with multiple conditions
- Managing larger state with additional game options
- Creating intuitive UI for five-choice selection
- Refactoring and improving code organization
- Writing clear, maintainable conditional statements

## 🎨 Features

- Five unique gesture options
- Real-time score tracking
- Computer opponent with random selection
- Clear visual feedback for game outcomes
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- [ ] Add gesture animations
- [ ] Implement sound effects for each gesture
- [ ] Create a rules modal/tutorial
- [ ] Add character themes (Big Bang Theory inspired)
- [ ] Implement difficulty levels with AI patterns
- [ ] Add statistics tracking (win/loss ratios per gesture)
- [ ] Best-of-7 tournament mode
- [ ] Local storage for persistent high scores

## 🎬 Origin

This game variation was invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla and later featured in the CBS sitcom *The Big Bang Theory*, where it became widely known.
